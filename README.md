Mac users should download the .dmg file and Windows users should download the .zip file.
I am not a certified or an official software developer on Mac/Windows so when opening/extracting
the game application, there will be a security warning and a potential block from opening the game.
If you want to play, you'll have to bypass these security warnings. I however, did not put in
malware or anything like that. That being said, you should still trust your gut on whether or not
it's a safe application.
If you do open it, there will probably be bugs because this is a testing build.
There are 2 ways to open it (on Mac at least). There is the application and a terminal script.
The terminal script will open up your terminal and it will log any errors/crashes.
If you do encounter a bug/crash and you'd like to report it, it would be helpful for me
to see the error message and any footage of the bug as well as what happened while you were playing
so I can fix it.
Any changes will be noted in the changelog below:
