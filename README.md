Mac users should download the .dmg file and Windows users should download the .zip file.
I am not a certified or an official software developer on Mac/Windows so when opening/extracting
the game application, there will be a security warning and a potential block from opening the game.
If you want to play, you'll have to bypass these security warnings. I however, did not put in
malware or anything like that. That being said, you should still trust your gut on whether or not
it's a safe application.
If you do open it, there will probably be bugs because this is a testing build.
There are 2 ways to open it (on Mac at least). There is the application and a terminal script.
The terminal script will open up your terminal and it will log any errors/crashes.
If you do encounter a bug/crash and you'd like to report it, it would be helpful for me
to see the error message and any footage of the bug as well as what happened while you were playing
so I can fix it.

DO NOT STEAL MY CODE, ART, OR ANY ASSETS!! I MADE ALL THIS BY MYSELF SO DONT YOU DARE AND I WILL
THROW HANDS

    my play tester

    Suggestions:
        Solitaire: auto-sort cards when all cards are revealed

    Found bugs:
        Solitaire: When an Ace pile has say a 4, and you want to move a 5 to it,
                    if that 5 has something under it, then the 5 + whatever is under it
                    will move to the Ace pile.
                    Expected behavior: the 5 + whatever is under it won't move to the Ace pile,
                        only between other non-Ace piles
        Title Screen: Solitaire's customization options (none) are not overriding
                        other games' customization options
